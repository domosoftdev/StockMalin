## 🚀 Vision
StockHome starts from a simple observation: most households don’t know **exactly** what’s in their pantry or fridge.  
The result? Expired food, duplicate purchases, and unnecessary waste.  

The project’s ambition is to create an app that becomes a **daily reflex** — as easy to use as a paper shopping list, but much smarter.  

StockHome aims to be:
- 🧠 **A discreet assistant**, anticipating household needs without being intrusive.  
- ♻️ **A responsible tool**, helping everyone reduce waste and consume more mindfully.  
- 🕒 **A time-saver**, automating repetitive tasks (stock checking, reminders, shopping lists).  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **A family project**, designed to be used by multiple people, with no technical barriers.  

Ultimately, StockHome strives to become the **household dashboard** — knowing what you have, what to buy, and when to consume it, effortlessly.

> *Simplify your stock management. Reduce waste. Save time.*
